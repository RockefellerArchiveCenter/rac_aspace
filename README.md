# rac_aspace

*Write a brief description of the project, explaining what it does in a couple of sentences.*

## Functionality

### Data Helpers


### Serialize


### Save in ArchivesSpace


### Delete in ArchivesSpace

RAC_ASpace takes the fetched data from the helpers and simplifies delete actions. This could include deletion of an entire repository, resource, archival object, or deleting a single value in one of the JSON arrays. The key functionality differentiates between the deletion of a first-class ArchivesSpace object (which requires a delete request) and deletion of a field value (which requires data deletion and then a push request).
