## Functionality

### Data Helpers

Target, extract, and modify structured data from ArchiveSpace to allow users to export, update, add, and delete data.

Data helpers enable cleanup tasks, changes to conform to new organizational policies and procedures, and to validate against existing archival and institutional standards. Data helper functionality includes:

- Retreive and modify notes attached to archival objects or resources
- Retreive and modify location data
- Retrieve and modify container data
- Identify unlinked agents, subjects, top containers, and digital objects
- Identify and retrieve undated archival objects

- Enable user input to target specfic objects and resources to retrieve or modify data
- Enable user input for configuration
