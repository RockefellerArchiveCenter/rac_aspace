# rac_aspace

*Write a brief description of the project, explaining what it does in a couple of sentences.*

## Functionality

### Data Helpers


### Serialize


### Save in ArchivesSpace

The RAC_ASpace library improves upon the ArchivesSnake saving functionality by gerneralizing processes and making it easier to save new JSON data and push that back up to ArchivesSpace.

We plan to do that by:
  * Generalizing the transformation from a JSONModel object fetched by ASNake to editable JSON
  * Simplify the process of replacing JSON content through the use of automated methods
  * Making Create and Update methods for pushing new or updated JSON data back to ArchivesSpace

### Delete in ArchivesSpace
